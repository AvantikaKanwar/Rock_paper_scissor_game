# Rock_paper_scissor_game
A rock-paper-scissors game is a beginner-friendly Python project that illustrates the use of input handling, conditional logic, and random selection. In its simplest form, the user is prompted to choose between "rock," "paper," or "scissors," while the computer randomly selects one of the three using Python’s random module. The outcome—win, lose, or draw—is then determined based on traditional rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. The program uses if-elif-else statements to evaluate the winner and provides feedback accordingly. For added depth, features such as score tracking, multiple rounds, or even a graphical interface using tkinter can be integrated. This project is not only fun but also effective for reinforcing programming fundamentals and building interactive applications.
